# about:me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Nikita Belov, a 19 y/o graduate programmer from Russia. During my Uni years I've written code in all kinds of languages, including Intel Assembly, C, Java, C#, C++, Kotlin, PHP and others. I have the most experience with PHP and Kotlin though.  
- I also participated in WorldSkills Russia Demo Exam as a part of my graduation project (Skills Parssport can be found [here](https://sp.dp.worldskills.ru/xYaY5X78a7L)). Oh, and my main graduation work was an Android app that aggregated data from various APIs in form of "achievements". If you want to take a look, it can be found [here](https://github.com/EZGGWP/Aggregate).
- I'm interested in a lot of network- and API-related stuff. As stated above, my graduation work (which is one of the biggest projects I made so far) half consisted of fetching data from APIs, but I also explored SmartThings' IoT automatization API and VK Callback API for chat bots (which I used to make a [chat bot](https://github.com/EZGGWP/VK-TS-Bot)). 
- Aside from using third-party APIs, I also developed backend and API for a university team project ([here](https://github.com/Anekdoteam/Filth-backend) it is).
- As a IoT fan, I made my own LED light controling device based on ESP8266 and developed an Android app to accompany it (which is not currently private, but I'll show it to you if you're interested).
- I'm looking forward to work as an Android developer, API engineer or a backend PHP developer, but I'm also interested in other positions.
